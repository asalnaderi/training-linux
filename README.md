A `README.md` is a text file with special characters that are used for formatting the text once uploaded.
It can be found in the root of any project to provide users with a description of the project
and any helpful instructions such as (assuming the project was a deployable product/service):

* A 'Design Guide' to explain the design of the product
* A 'User Guide' to explain how the product can be used once deployed
* A 'Developer Guide' to explain how a developer can maintain, test and deploy the product

# Training Revision Notes

_INSTRUCTION: Populate this README.md file with markdown text formatted notes about what you've learnt._

See [Getting Started with GitHub Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github)

This will accomplish a couple of aims:

1. Give you training in Markdown text formatting
2. Introduce you in maintaining good documentation with your projects
3. Help you to think about your learning experience and capture revision notes
4. Provide others looking at your project with a quick understanding of what you've learnt (like a resume)

_Bonus points for making use of Markdown formatting tricks like links, Bullet lists, Tables and Headings._
